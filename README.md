# Code the Dream: Prework Portfolio (`ctd-prework`)

Welcome to my **Code the Dream Prework** portfolio ‚Äî a structured journey through drawing, animation, and interactive programming using JavaScript and p5.js. This repo captures my learning, coding practice, and reflections as I complete the Intro to JS curriculum on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming).

Each section is organized into folders by topic, with working sketches in `sketch.js`, supporting files, and journal entries. I've treated this project like a real developer would: with version control, clean structure, and thoughtful commit messages.

## üê∏ Current Project: Simple Frog Face Sketch

**Location:** `01_drawing_basics/JustStart/`  
This was my first creative project using `ellipse(x, y, w, h)`. I built a simple frog face by layering ellipses with custom positions. I ran into some beginner errors (like missing semicolons), but I fixed them and learned how the coordinate system really works.

## üß† Personal Learning Goals

- Practice thoughtful version control with Git (backdating meaningful commits)
- Create notebook-style reflections on each challenge
- Develop confidence using p5.js to animate and interact
- Submit a portfolio that shows both _technical growth_ and _dedication_

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- JavaScript
- p5.js
- Git + GitHub
- VS Code + Live Server
- Terminal (macOS)

## üßæ License

This is part of my **personal learning journey** and shared as a public repo to reflect my commitment and growth as a developer in the Code the Dream program.
